        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves to make excellent and attractive websites. I've already made two WordPress sites; one is a personal blog, the other is a portfolio for my wife. I was raised in Atlanta but spent some time outside of DC during highschool, and ultimately moved to Charleston. I work in the tech industry right now for one of the best companies in town. We love to innovate and are currently part of one of the most important tech projects in the country. We have built and are maintaining the enterprise application for the US Department of Veteran's Affairs to process claims for reimbursement online.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a cook, janitor, and construction worker but currently work in enterprise software Production Operations Support.</p>
